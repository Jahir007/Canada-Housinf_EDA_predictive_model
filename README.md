# Canada Housing EDA and Predictive Model

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building predictive models for the Canadian housing market. The goal is to analyze historical housing data, identify trends, and develop models to predict mortgage rates and house prices for different cities in Canada for the upcoming three years.

## Overview

The project consists of the following phases:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical housing data from reliable sources such as government databases, real estate websites, or APIs.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset and preprocess the data for model training.

4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with different predictive models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to find the best-performing model.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), or R-squared.

6. **Prediction:** Once the best model is identified, use it to predict mortgage rates and house prices for different cities in Canada for the next three years.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing library for handling arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Visualization libraries for creating insightful plots and charts.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch:** Deep learning frameworks for building neural network models (if applicable).

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:** Run scripts to collect housing data from the specified sources.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyze the dataset using Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts to gain insights into the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and create new features if necessary.
4. **Model Training:** Train different predictive models using the prepared dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. **Prediction:** Use the best-performing model to predict mortgage rates and house prices for the desired cities in Canada.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods, gradient boosting, or time series forecasting for improved predictions.
- Explore additional features that may influence housing prices, such as economic indicators, population demographics, or government policies.
- Deploy the predictive model as a web application or API for real-time predictions and user interaction.
